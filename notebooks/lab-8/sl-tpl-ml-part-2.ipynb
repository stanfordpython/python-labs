    "## Overview\n",
    "In the second part of our \\*sniff\\* *FINAL* \\*sniff\\* lab, we're going to explore some of the machine learning models that we discussed in Monday's lecture. We'll be playing around a lot with scikit-learn and applying it to real-world dataset. There won't be many new algorithms in this lab that we didn't see in lecture; instead, this will give you the chance to play around with models, feature selection, and hyperparameters to develop a better intuition for how machine learning models behave on interesting data.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this setup looks similar to what we did in Monday's lecture, that's because it is pretty similar. Monday's lecture covered a lot of ground, and especially if you're less familiar with machine learning in other contexts, the hope is this lab is a friendly environment in which to get a bit more comfortable with how ML works in the real world.\n",

    "Predicting health insurance charges is an important problem in the United States. In this task, we will predict the health insurance charges to patients as a function of various health data features about the patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "[The dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance) consists of 1338 examples of health insurance charges. The features of each example are (in order) as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- age: age of primary beneficiary\n",
    "- sex: insurance contractor gender, female, male (1 female, 0 male)\n",
    "- bmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height,\n",
    "- objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9\n",
    "- children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents\n",
    "- smoker: Smoking\n",
    "- region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest. (1 northeast, 2 northwest, 3 southeast, 4 southwest)\n",
    "\n",
    "The final column in the dataset is the cost billed by the health insurance, and is the variable we are trying to predict:\n",

How low are you able to get the loss?\n",

Here are a couple suggestions: consider adding a feature which is the log of the age column, as there's significant density in the bottom left of the graph. Alternatively, choose a feature (any feature!) and find the point at which increasing the degree of a polynomial fit begins to decrease the accuracy. The possibilities here are endless!!)\n",

    "x = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "x_1\\\\\n",
    "x_2\\\\\n",

Least squares is a linear model - as we've seen in lecture, it entails fitting a line to the data, such that we predict $y_i = \\theta x_i$. How on earth can we possibly hope to fit this data effectively?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that, if we have an understanding of the function mapping $x$ to $y$, we can add the appropriate features to our feature vector in order to dramatically improve performance. We then construct the following feature vector, $x'$, from our old one, $x$: $x' = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's take a quick step back and evaluate what we've just done. We've taken highly, _highly_ nonlinear data, and approximated it with a linear model. _We used a line to model something that isn't a line._ Isn't that incredible?"
