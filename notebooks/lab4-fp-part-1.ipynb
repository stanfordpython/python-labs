For example, `functools.reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` calculates `((((1 + 2) + 3) + 4) + 5)`. The left argument, `x`, is the accumulated value and the right argument, `y`, is the update value from the sequence. If the optional `initializer` is present, it is placed before the items of the sequence in the calculation, and serves as a default when the iterable is empty. If `initializer` is not given and `iterable` contains only one item, the first item is returned.\n",

Unfortunately, we can't just refer to `+` as a function - it's a builtin syntax element. To solve this problem, The `operator` module exports callable functions for each builtin operation. These operators can simplify some common uses of lambdas, and should be used wherever possible, since in almost all cases they are faster than constructing and repeatedly invoking a lambda function.\n",

    "When ordering sequences, or finding the largest or smallest element of a sequence, Python defaults to a standard ordering for sequence elements of certain types. For instance, a collection of strings will be sorted alphabetically (by ASCII value), and a collection of tuples will sort lexicographically. Sometimes, however, we need to sort based on a custom key value. In Python, we can supply an optional `key` argument to `sorted(seq)`, `max(seq)`, `min(seq)`, or `seq.sort()` to determine the values used for ordering elements in a sequence. In Python, both `sorted(seq)` and `seq.sort()` are stable.\n",
