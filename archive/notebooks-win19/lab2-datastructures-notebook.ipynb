    "\n",
    "The primary goal of the first half is to ensure that your Python installation process went smoothly, and that there are no lingering Python installation bugs floating around.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second half focuses more on using data structures to solve some interesting problems.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Note: These labs are *designed* to be long! You shouldn't be able to finish all the problems in one class period. Work through as much as you can in the time allotted, but also feel free to skip from question to question freely. The extra problems are intended to be extra practice, if you want to hone your Python skills even more.**\n",
