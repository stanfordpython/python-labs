    "### Automatic Caching\n",

More information on function attributes is available in the latter half of Lab 3.*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note\n",
    "There are a lot of subtleties to this function, since functions can be called in a number of different ways. How does your `print_args` handle keyword arguments or even keyword-only arguments? Variadic positional arguments? Variadic keyword arguments? For more customization, look at `fn.__defaults__`, `fn.__kwdefaults__`, as well as other attributes of `fn.__code__`."
